# RESTful-API-CURD

**Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to assess your skills and understanding of backend development using Express.js and MongoDB. You will be required to create a simple RESTful API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection in a MongoDB database.

**Requirements:

1. Set up a new Express.js project with the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a MongoDB database or use an existing one.
3. Implement the following endpoints:
   - GET `/api/items` - Retrieve all items from the database.
   - GET `/api/items/:id` - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
   - POST `/api/items` - Create a new item in the database.
   - PUT `/api/items/:id` - Update an existing item by its ID.
   - DELETE `/api/items/:id` - Delete an item by its ID.
4. Use appropriate error handling and return meaningful error messages for each endpoint.
5. Ensure proper validation of data before performing database operations.
6. Write clear and concise code with appropriate comments.
7. Implement basic error logging using a logging library of your choice (e.g., Winston).
8. Create a README file explaining how to set up and run your project.


**Create a MongoDB database:

If you don't have a MongoDB instance set up, you can either install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.
Create a new database for your application.

Remember to replace 'mongodb://localhost:27017' with the appropriate MongoDB connection URL, 'your_database_name' with the actual database name you created, and 'items' with the desired collection name.

** Set Up

$ git clone https://github.com/AJEETSINGH8139/RESTful-API-CURD.git
$ cd RESTful-API-CURD

*Run project

$ node server.js

Your RESTful API is now ready to perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB collection.
